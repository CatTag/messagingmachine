    Thanks for testing Seaglass and for taking the time to report issues. GitHub is
    where we store and track all issues, feature requests and bugs, and we will do
    our best to make sure that no GitHub issue goes unnoticed.

    Please note that it is very important that you post the version number of Seaglass
    that you have experienced the problem with. You can either find this in the "About
    Seaglass" window in the Seaglass menu of the app, or you can find the Seaglass
    application in Finder and open "Get Info" in the File menu.

    If possible, please make sure to also test against the latest version of Seaglass. 
    It is extremely useful to us to know whether an issue affects the latest build!

    If you are posting about a crash, i.e. "Seaglass quit unexpectedly", then please

    and System Configuration" section into your GitHub issue. You can also attach
